# Corneal Nerve Fiber Tracing Database
A total of 1578 images of corneal subbasal epithelium from 108 normal and pathological subjects were acquired using a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph equipped with a Rostock Cornea Module (HRT-III) microscope (Heidelberg Engineering Inc.). The 108 subjects included: 30 healthy subjects; 18 subjects with diabetes; and 60 subjects with dry eye disease. The image resolution was 384x384 pixels, and the field of view was 400x400$ um2.Â­ The nerves appear as bright curvilinear structures lying over a darker background. The reference groundtruth was segmented manually by an ophthalmologist, who traced the centerlines of all visible nerves using an in-house program written in Matlab (Mathworks R2017, Natwick).

# Corneal Nerve Fiber Tortuosity Database
This is a local dataset which contains 410 CCM images.  These images were categorized into four groups based on fiber tortuosity level: two clinical authors independently labeled the tortuosity level according to a previously published protocol, and the consensus between them was then used as groundtruth. 
{Level 1}: the fibers appear almost straight (56 images); 
{Level 2}: the fibers appear moderately tortuous (216 images); 
{Level 3}: the fibers are quite tortuous; the amplitude of the changes in the fiber direction is quite severe (108 images); 
{Level 4}: the fibers appear very tortuous, presenting frequent changes in the fiber direction (30 images).
